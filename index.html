  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I'm a recent grad who earned a piece of paper that says I can do <strong>Web Design and Interactive Media.</strong> I love all things web related and am frequently researching and learning as much as I can. I also enjoy <strong>music</strong>, <strong>books</strong>, and lots of <strong>tea</strong>.</p>
  <p>Lately mindfulness has been important to me. I find it helps with adding balance to a busy life, in a sometimes chaotic society. But mostly, enjoy spending good ol quality time with family and friends.</p>

  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  <p>I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area in California--but more specifically, a city called <em>Santa Clara</em>. It's not as known as San Jose or San Francisco, but we've recently acquired a large stadium which is now the 49ers training ground.</p>
